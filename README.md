3000 Nauts, pioneering exploration of DeFi protocols on Optimism L2.üî¥  35% PGF

## Story
The OptiNauts are an NFT collection on Optimism L2, focused around onboarding and educating DeFi & Web3 to new and existing users. We will be launching a learn2earn quiz along with other incentivized quests to ready our community to participate. This is just one of many examples of utility to provide to our holders & community.

The inspiration of the name OptiNauts came from the art, love for sci-fi and a show my daughter watched called Octonauts. I grew up loving Sci-Fi movies like Star Wars and games like Halo spending countless hours watching and playing them. A lot of my art and the music I have worked on, uses space as a metaphor of discovering and overcoming, solving the problems at hand. The idea behind OptiNauts is a community that pioneers DeFi protocols, backed with education and resources, while solving dilemmas with onboarding through the attractiveness of a welcoming community, web3 & NFTs.

## Author inspire
I am very big on participation and self-custody. I also dont promote trading or unhealthy habits. I want to educate users about why crypto and blockchain are here and the use-cases/possibilities they provide as well as how to participate safely and responsibly, starting with wallet security. I always wanted to start my own project, waited for a good enough reason and felt @optimismFND to be a great match in terms of the Public Goods philosophy and incentives around the ecosystem.

I collaborated w/ @MareMartian on the artwork. (Amazing, underrated artist that is done a lot of art for me in the past like project covers & characters usually around a space).
